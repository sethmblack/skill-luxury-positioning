# Luxury Positioning

Distinguish true luxury from vulgar ostentation. Evaluate and reposition value based on Coco Chanel's principle: "Some people think luxury is the opposite of poverty. It is not. It is the opposite of vulgarity."

---

## When to Use

- Positioning a premium product or service
- Evaluating whether something communicates quality or pretension
- Client wants to "feel more luxurious" but current approach feels cheap or showy
- Price is high but perceived value does not match
- Brand communicates wealth but not taste
- Users/customers seem embarrassed rather than proud
- Competition on price signals rather than actual quality

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| subject | Yes | Product, service, experience, or brand to evaluate |
| current_positioning | Yes | How it currently presents itself to the market |
| price_point | No | Where it sits in the market |
| target_audience | No | Who this is meant to serve |
| competitors | No | What alternatives exist at similar price points |

## The Chanel Luxury Framework

### Principle 1: Luxury vs. Vulgarity

Vulgarity is excess that signals insecurity. True luxury is confident restraint that needs no announcement.

**Vulgar signals:**
- Prominent logos and brand markers
- Gold where gold is not needed
- Complexity to justify price
- Features added to impress, not serve
- Loud claims of quality

**Luxury signals:**
- Quality apparent in use, not display
- Restraint that suggests confidence
- Simplicity that only the secure can afford
- Details noticed only by those who look closely
- Silence about own excellence

**Chanel's bottle:** Chanel No. 5 came in a simple rectangular bottle when competitors used ornate crystal. The confidence to be plain was itself the luxury.

### Principle 2: Comfort as the True Measure

"Luxury must be comfortable, otherwise it is not luxury."

**Questions:**
- Does this make life better or just look expensive?
- Does using this feel good or merely impressive?
- Is the experience pleasurable or performative?
- Would the user choose this in private, not just public?

**False luxury:** Uncomfortable furniture that photographs well
**True luxury:** Comfortable furniture that happens to be beautiful

### Principle 3: The Test of Time

Luxury transcends fashion. True quality remains desirable across decades.

**Timeless luxury:**
- Based on enduring human desires
- Materials that age beautifully
- Design that does not date
- Value that appreciates or holds

**Fashionable pretense:**
- Based on current status signals
- Materials that show wear poorly
- Design that will look dated
- Value that depreciates rapidly

### Principle 4: Democratized Elegance vs. Exclusive Ostentation

Chanel made elegance accessible through the little black dress. The distinction is between sharing quality and hoarding status symbols.

**Quality luxury:** High standards available to those who seek them
**Status luxury:** Barriers designed to exclude, not to ensure quality

**The test:** Is exclusivity in service of quality, or quality in service of exclusivity?

### Principle 5: The Invisible Excellence

The highest luxury is excellence so integrated it becomes invisible. You do not notice it; you simply feel better.

**Examples:**
- A well-designed tool that disappears in use
- Service so anticipatory you never have to ask
- Quality so consistent you forget it could be otherwise
- Design so right you cannot imagine alternatives

## Evaluation Process

### Step 1: Current Positioning Analysis

Assess how the subject currently presents:

| Element | Current Approach | Signal Type | Notes |
|---------|------------------|-------------|-------|
| Visual identity | [Description] | Vulgar/Neutral/Luxury | [Evidence] |
| Messaging | [Description] | Vulgar/Neutral/Luxury | [Evidence] |
| Price communication | [Description] | Vulgar/Neutral/Luxury | [Evidence] |
| Quality evidence | [Description] | Vulgar/Neutral/Luxury | [Evidence] |

### Step 2: Apply the Chanel Tests

| Test | Question | Current State | Assessment |
|------|----------|---------------|------------|
| Vulgarity | Does this announce itself or let quality speak? | | |
| Comfort | Does this make life better or just look expensive? | | |
| Timelessness | Will this still communicate quality in 10 years? | | |
| Democratization | Is exclusivity serving quality or ego? | | |
| Invisibility | Does excellence integrate or perform? | | |

### Step 3: Identify Vulgar Elements

List anything that signals insecurity, performance, or trying too hard:

| Element | Why It's Vulgar | Underlying Insecurity |
|---------|-----------------|----------------------|
| [Element] | [Signal problem] | [What it compensates for] |

### Step 4: Identify Missing Luxury Elements

List what true luxury would include:

| Missing Element | Why It Matters | How to Achieve |
|-----------------|----------------|----------------|
| [Element] | [Luxury function] | [Implementation] |

### Step 5: Repositioning Recommendations

## Constraints

- Luxury positioning is not about price; expensive can be vulgar
- Some markets genuinely want ostentation; acknowledge when repositioning conflicts with market reality
- Do not confuse minimalism with luxury; both can be either vulgar or elegant
- Accessibility and luxury are not opposites; Chanel made elegance democratic
- Cultural context matters; signals read differently across cultures

---

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Subject is genuinely low quality | Luxury positioning cannot fix quality problems; flag honestly |
| Market wants ostentation | Document the Chanel perspective; acknowledge market reality |
| Price does not support luxury | Suggest quality path that current economics allow |
| Competitor owns luxury positioning | Find differentiated luxury angle; do not copy |
| Brand history is vulgar | Acknowledge; luxury repositioning requires time and consistency |

```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "Evaluate luxury positioning for our premium productivity app. We charge $300/year. Current messaging emphasizes 'Premium features for power users' with gold accents and a 'VIP' tier."

**Output:**

## Luxury Positioning Analysis: Premium Productivity App

### Current State Assessment

**Luxury Score:** 3/10

**Current positioning:** Signals exclusivity through price and "VIP" language, uses gold visual elements to communicate premium, emphasizes power user features as justification for price.

### Vulgarity Audit

| Element | Signal | Verdict |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Gold accents | "This costs money" | VULGAR |
| "VIP" tier naming | "You're special for paying" | VULGAR |
| "Power users" messaging | Justifying price through complexity | VULGAR |
| Feature count emphasis | More = worth more | VULGAR |
| Price prominence | Look how expensive we are | VULGAR |
| Clean interface | Respects user attention | LUXURY |
| Reliable sync | Excellence in core function | LUXURY |

### The Five Tests

| Test | Assessment | Evidence |
|------|------------|----------|
| Vulgarity vs. Restraint | FAIL | Gold accents and VIP language announce premium-ness |
| Comfort vs. Performance | PARTIAL | Good core experience, but messaging is performative |
| Timelessness vs. Fashion | FAIL | Gold/VIP aesthetic dates quickly |
| Quality vs. Exclusivity | FAIL | "VIP" frames price as status barrier, not quality indicator |
| Integration vs. Display | PARTIAL | Product integrates well; marketing displays wealth signals |

### Elements to Remove or Transform

**Vulgar elements to eliminate:**
1. Gold accents - Signal insecurity about value -> Use refined neutrals that communicate confidence
2. "VIP" tier naming - Cheap status play -> Simply call it by name or "Complete"
3. "Power users" focus - Implies normal users unwelcome -> "For people who value their time"
4. Feature count lists - More is not better -> Focus on outcomes, not capabilities
5. Price prominence - Confidence does not apologize -> Let price be found, not announced

**Neutral elements to elevate:**
1. Clean interface -> Emphasize in marketing; this IS the luxury
2. Reliability -> "Just works" is the ultimate luxury; make this the story

### Elements to Add or Strengthen

1. **Outcome-focused messaging** - "Reclaim your attention" rather than "50+ features"
2. **Confidence in simplicity** - Show the calm interface as the value, not feature lists
3. **Quality-over-quantity positioning** - "Everything you need, nothing you don't"
4. **Invisible excellence** - Customer stories about problems they no longer have
5. **Democratic quality** - Premium because of quality, not because of exclusion

### Repositioned Vision

The app becomes a quiet tool that respects your attention and simply works. No gold, no VIP language, no feature bragging. The luxury is in what it does not do: it does not interrupt, does not confuse, does not demand attention. It costs $300/year because excellence has a cost, not because exclusivity has a fee. Users recommend it by saying "I stopped thinking about productivity apps."

### Chanel Assessment

> "Some people think luxury is the opposite of poverty. It is not. It is the opposite of vulgarity."

The current positioning is vulgar: gold accents announcing price, VIP language creating false exclusivity, feature lists justifying cost. True luxury would be confidence: the best productivity experience, priced fairly for its quality, marketed through the calmness it creates rather than the status it confers. After repositioning, users would feel smart for finding it, not special for affording it.
